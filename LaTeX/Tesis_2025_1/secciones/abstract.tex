\end{center}

This report presents the design and implementation of a 1DOF oscillating test rig, motivated by the importance of mechanical oscillation testing to optimize design and ensure the operational integrity of systems, especially in mechatronic engineering. The paper highlights the difficulty of predicting the response of components and systems to oscillatory loads without experimental testing, which can result in poor designs and premature failures.

The proposed test rig seeks to validate designs and diagnose faults in prototypes or components by subjecting them to controlled and representative oscillatory conditions. Its development is justified by the need to understand and mitigate the effects of oscillations on mechatronic systems, improve their reliability and safety, and pave the way for future research in oscillation control.
